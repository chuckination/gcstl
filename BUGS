gcstl-0.3.2
-----------

These aren't entirely bugs, but they are improvements that I want to make in the immediate future.

- Function failure returns currently have no meaning.  Need to add in support for errno.h codes to add context to the failures.
- Need to complete doxygen for all interfaces.
- Once doxygen is completed for all interfaces, I can generate documentation to ship in the tarballs and post up on the sourceforge.net website.


gcstl-0.3.1
-----------

I recently discovered that gcstl_map has some serious bugs.  I thought I got all of those nasty ones worked out when I was debugging gcstl_rbtree, but there were some more.

- gcstl_map_data() is exposed from gcstl_map.h, but is not a real function and breaks the linking stage if you attempt to use it.
- gcstl_map_initialize() is flawed and does not allow for proper initialization of the rbtree component of a map.
