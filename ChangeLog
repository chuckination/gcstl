gcstl-0.3.1
-----------

Did some maintenance on the 0.3.2 ebuild.  Previously, it was setup to pull
the package from my personal server that wasn't hosting it, so I modified it
to pull from a sourceforge mirror.  Also modified the LICENSE declaration to
specify that the library is indeed dual licenses GPL-2/LGPL-2


Fixed some bugs that came up through casual usage of the gcstl_map module:

- gcstl_map_data() is exposed from gcstl_map.h, but is not a real function and breaks the linking stage if you attempt to use it.
- Removed gcstl_map_data()
- Added gcstl_map_value() and gcstl_map_key()

- gcstl_map_initialize() is flawed and does not allow for proper initialization of the rbtree component of a map.
- Added logic to properly handle the creation and initialization of the rbtree backend for the map.
