----------

First source release (0.3.0) to be soon.
Time to define goals for next release (0.3.1).

-  Automated generation of documentation via doxygen, I already have a basic
   setup, but I need to refine it for this specific case.  This will also be
   the basis of the first webpages for sourceforge.

-  More thorough testing.  I've done just enough this release to make sure
   nothing will blow up badly, but not much more than that.  I would like
   to achieve as high line coverage as possible.

-  Attempt to hash out implementations of sets and maps that can have make
   use of different underlying container structures.

-  Attempt implementation of AVL trees.

-  Attempt implementation of hash tables with linear collision handling,
   quadratic collision handling, and chaining with both lists and maps.

-  Review C++ deque implementations for potential back porting.

-  Review C++ multimap and multiset implementations for potential back porting.
